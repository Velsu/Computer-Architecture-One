1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    Thanks to multiple cores and interrupts CPU can handle multiple concurrent tasks which will not freeze CPU's action when multiple programs request attention.

2)  Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Machine Language is made up only with binaries 1 and 0 and are directly sent to the CPU as electrical impulse (0 is off and 1 is on).
    Assembly language is more human friendly and consists of functions that are more readable.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    Because Graphic Cards are dedicated for that single purpose, they have their own graphical chip and their sole purpose is to process 3D graphics and take the load off from CPU.

4)  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    GPU thanks to doing similar task over and over again manage to "learn" and improve their neural network with that. GPU in comparison to CPU are less flexible but they can compute same instructions in parallel. GPUs have additional advantages over CPUs, these include having more computational units and having a higher bandwidth to retrieve from memory. Furthermore, in applications requiring image processing (i.e. Convolution Neural Networks) GPU graphics specific capabilities can be exploited to further speed up calculations.
